"""Actions that DoorPi can perform in response to events.

Submodules of ``doorpi.actions`` implement actions usable from the
configuration file. An action instantiator must be tagged with the
``@action(ac_name)`` decorator in order to be recognized. The
instantiator is passed the parameters defined in the configuration
file, and it must return a Callable which will be called to fire
the action. The returned Callable must take two parameters; the
Event ID (a string that uniquely identifies the currently handled
event) and a dict of extra data. When an action performs any log
output, it should prepend its messages with ``[EVENT_ID]``. What kind
of extra data is passed depends on the actual event being handled.

When loading DoorPi, all submodules of ``doorpi.actions`` will be
imported and the ``@action``s defined therein registered with the
dispatcher. Modules that fail to import are logged and skipped. This
is so that if a module requires extra dependencies that are not
currently available, only the actions it defines will be unusable,
but the rest of DoorPi still functions as normal.

For more details of the required methods on action classes, see the
definition of `Action` below.
