! fix issue or kown bug

Version: 3.0.0b5 (2021-03-05)  {{{1
-----------------------------------

+ DoorPi can now be run using `python -m doorpi`
+ Added a new `waitevent` action
~ Web server pages are now integrated into the `doorpi` package.
  A separate installation of the web pages is no longer necessary.
~ Rewrote the integrated web server based on aiohttp
~ Changed to using Entrypoints to discover actions, keyboards and sip
  phone implementations.  This allows to easily extend DoorPi using
  additional packages, without changes to the DoorPi code itself.
! Fix "must be str, not PosixPath" in setup.py
! sip: Fix "realm" auto-setting not occuring

Version: 3.0.0b4 (2020-08-12)  {{{1
-----------------------------------

+ Version numbers of the Python package are now managed by setuptools_scm.
~ Update gitignore template
! Fix closing of configuration definition resources

Version: 3.0.0b3 (2020-08-12)  {{{1
-----------------------------------

+ systemd-notify and watchdog support. This allows systemd to better track DoorPi's internal state,
  and react faster to problems like hangs or crashes.
+ Allow specifying specific modules for `--debug` and `--trace`. This is mainly useful for
  developers; if you're reporting a bug, please attach a full trace log as usual.
- Remove support for linphone.
- Restarting the daemon by issuing `doorpi_cli restart` is no longer supported. If you use custom
  scripts that rely on this command, you will need to adjust them appropriately. This does not
  affect systemd.
~ Changed the configuration system to use the TOML format.  Due to numerous changes in the
  configuration layout, old configuration files cannot be migrated automatically.
~ The main executable's name was changed from `doorpi_cli` to `doorpi`. To ensure proper
  functioning of the daemon, reexecute the setup steps. You may have to adjust manual launch
  scripts if you're using any.
~ Fully rewrite and modernize the SIP stack and make pjsua2 functional again.
~ Instead of a sine wave, a short WAV file is used as default ring tone. This is installed into
  `$prefix/share/doorpi/dialtone.wav`, which is also the new default ring tone file path.
~ Requirement texts use reStructuredText instead of inline HTML. Pages look cleaner and are easier
  to maintain, but, in order to display them correctly, **docutils need to be installed**. Without
  docutils, the reST source will be displayed as preformatted text block.
~ The systemd socket by default now only binds to the IPv6 loopback address. IPv4 is unchanged.
~ Data files (including systemd units) are now installed relative to the Python executable's
  prefix. This allows installation into virtualenvs without `sudo`.
~ The keyboard interfaces have been reworked.
~ Actions have been rewritten as proper classes. If you implemented custom actions, you will have
  to adjust your code. See the documentation in `doorpi/actions/__init__.py`.
~ Some actions have been renamed or merged; please update your configuration accordingly.

  Old: `ipsrpc_setvalue:<key>,<value>`
  New: `symcon_ips3:set,<key>,<value>`

  Old: `ipsrpc_call_value:<key>`
  New: `symcon_ips3:call,<key>`

  Old: `out_triggered:<p>,<v>,<s>,<h>,[i]`
  New: `out:<p>,<v>,<s>,<h>,[i]`
  (`out:` actions without hold time are unaffected)
! Add a LICENSE file
! Properly set access permissions for GPIO, audio and video devices when running under systemd
! Receiving SIGINT, SIGHUP or SIGTERM now properly shuts down DoorPi instead of killing the
  process. After receiving 3 or more of such signals, the main thread's stack will be dumped and
  the process terminates immediately. (Note: Python signal handling caveats apply.)
  The handling of other signals is unchanged - this still allows one to, for example, kill the
  DoorPi process in a terminal with SIGQUIT.

Version: 3.0beta2 (2018-11-20)  {{{1
------------------------------------
+ Web service: Use systemd sockets. This allows to use privileged ports (e.g. 80, the old default)
  without the need to run as root. **Note**: If using systemd, the web server port in `doorpi.ini`
  is ignored, as it is now up to systemd to set up the socket. Use:

    systemctl edit --full doorpi.socket

  and change the `ListenStream=` line to configure the port.
~ Web service: Use intra-domain references, instead of wrestling with HTTP headers
  **Note**: This requires updated DoorPiWeb files
! Web service: Protect against directory traversal attacks

Version: 3.0beta1 (2018-11-06)  {{{1
-------------------------------------
+ Ability to run without root privileges
+ Basic systemd support (see below)
~ Rewrite setup routines. Allows packaging
~ Port existing code to Python 3 (not everything tested yet)
    Some changes here were done by <https://github.com/Python3pkg>)
~ base_path defaults to current user's $HOME if not yet configured
~ Web service: new default port 50371 (from 80)
- Web service no longer tries to fall back to different ports
- Web service no longer falls back to online resources if local resources are not found
! Various fixes for random coding-related stuff; see commit history if you're interested in details

Notes about systemd:
* Some features require systemd >= 235, which is not available on Raspbian Jessie.
* DoorPi will not run as root anymore. In order to access GPIO pins, the supplementary group `gpio`
  will be added to the daemon's set of groups. If your system doesn't use this group, or uses a
  different one, you need to modify the service definition accordingly.
  **Do NOT just change the User to root.** It should be trivial to find out what kind of permission
  is needed to access GPIO (if any at all).
* The systemd service expects the config file to exist at `/etc/doorpi/doorpi.ini`
  As DoorPi normally does not (and should not!) have write access there, the configuration web
  interface will not be able to save changes. Do not use it, just write to the file directly.
